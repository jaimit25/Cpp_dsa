In C++, we can make operators to work for user defined classes. This means C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading.
For example, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +.
Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Number, Fractional Number, Big Integer, etc.


In C++, stream insertion operator “<<” is used for output and extraction operator “>>” is used for input. 
We must know the following things before we start overloading these operators. 
1) cout is an object of ostream class and cin is an object of istream class 
2) These operators must be overloaded as a global function. And if we want to allow them to access private data members of the class, we must make them friend.
